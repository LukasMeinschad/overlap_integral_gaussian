# Solid-State Aspects of Matrices

Literature: _chemistry and physics of matrix isolated species, L. Andrews and M. Moskovits_

## Introduction 

+ Chapter is about diatomic molecules in rare-gas, nitrogen or axygen matrices
+ Investigates physical phenomena like crystal-field splitting or anharmonic phonon coupling

In former days, matrix-isolated molecules were descirbed by the frozen-gas model. Most spectroscopic measurments were performed with disordered specimen.

+ Molecular crystals are built out of molecules that retain in the crystal almost the same internal structure that they have in the gas phase.
+ Internal Vibrations of the molecules making up the lattice are, in general, seperable from external or lattice vibrations due to the considerably greater strength of intramolecular forces.

Total Hamiltonian of the systems consisting of vibrons (normal coordinate $q$) and phonons ($Q$) can be written

$$H = T_Q + T_q + V(q,Q)$$

The solution to the Schrödinger equation withing the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is:

$$\psi = \phi(q,Q)\Phi(Q)$$

+ Adiabatic Seperability into vibron and phonon motions is determined by the magintude $[\omega(Q)/\omega(q)]^{1/2}$

+ If vibrations of the particles have only small ampltudes, then they can be calculated quite accurately.
+ Expansion of the Potential of the Crystal with _Taylor Series_ again, truncation after the quacratic term $\to$ harmonic approximation

Molecules are not spherically symmetric, they perform two types of motions and are trapped in relatively deep potential wells.

They can perform small translational oscillations around well-defined equilibirum positions in which the orientation does not change $\to$ Librations (position of center of gravity does not change)

+ Note that librations are still poorly understood, because here the harmonic approximation yields bad results. Often have large amplitude $(\approx 10-15°$ in solid $\alpha-N_2$)


Harmonic Approximation for translations consists of expanding the potential up to second order in the atomic or molecular displacement around some local minimum and then diagonalizing the quadratic Hamiltonian. The expansion of the speific potential $V$ in a Taylor series in the appropiate displacement coordinate $x$ (for translation, orientation, combined motion) has the form

$$V(x) = V_0 + \sum_{i}\left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial x_i}\right)_o x_i + \frac{1}{2!} \sum_i \sum_j \left( \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}\right) x_ix_j + \text{higher terms}$$
