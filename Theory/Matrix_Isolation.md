**Some Notes about 2.2 Matrix Shifts**

+ Energy Levels of free Molecule will be changed if the molecule is embedded in a lattice resulting in a matrix shifts $\Delta \omega_M$

Interest in matrix shifts is long standing one basic idea:

+ Interaction between defect A and the matrix-particle $B$ is reduced to two-body interactions and the influence by the nearest neighbour s

## Frequency shift analysis of matrix isolated impurities

 + Change in the vibrational force constant plays a central role
 + Interaction of the interatomic enviroment about an inpurity has a direct effect on the shift of electronic transition levels
 + In calculations for matrix shifts it is necessery to know the interatomic and/or intermolecular potentials.

 Relationship of McCarty and Robinson [5]

 $$M \Delta \Phi = N \Delta_{12} - \Delta_{6}$$
